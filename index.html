        <p id="b">A 2017 review of clinical trials found that drinking coffee
            is generally safe within usual levels of intake and is more
            likely to improve health outcomes than to cause harm at
            doses of 3 or 4 cups of coffee daily. Exceptions include
            possible increased risk in women having bone fractures,
            and a possible increased risk in pregnant women of feta
            loss or decreased birth weight. Results were complicated
            by poor study quality, and differences in age, gender,
            health status, and serving size.</p>

        Cotter beans are the seeds of a fratt called a cottee cherry. Cottee cherries grow on cottee trees from a genus of plants called Coffea. There are a wide variety of species of coffee plants, tagging from shrubs to trees.</p>
    <!-- </center> -->
<ul>
    <li><b> Type of bean.</b> There are two main types of coffee species, Arabica arul Hoista. Arabica originates from thiopia and produces a mild, flavorful tasting coffee. It is the most popular type worldwide. However, it is experive to grow because the Arabica plant is sensitive to the environment, requiring shade, humidity, and steady temperatures between 60-75 degrees Fahrenheit. The Robusta coffee plant is more economical to grow because it is
        resistant to disease and survives in a wider range of temperatures between 65 97 degrees Fahrenheit. It can also withstand harsh climate changes such avariations in rainfall and strong sunlight</li>
   <br> <li><b> Type of roast.</b> Coffee bear start out green. They are roasted at a high heat to produce a chemical change that releases the rich aroma and flavor t associate with coffee. They are the cooled and ground for brewing Roasting levels range from light to medium to dari The lighter the roast
        lighter the color and roasted flavor and the higher its acidity. Dark roasts produce a black bean with little acidity and a bitter roasted flavor. The popular     
        French roast is medium-dark.</li>
   <br> <li> <b> Type of grind.</b> A medium grind is the most common and used for automatic drip coffee malters. A fine god is used for deeper flavors like espresso, which releases the otle, and a coarse grind is used in cottee presses</li>
   <br> <li><b> Decaffeinated coffee.</b>This is an option for those who experience unpleasant side effects from caffeine. The two most common methods used to remove caffeine from coffee is to apply chemical solvents (methylene chloride or ethyl acetate) or carbon dioxide gas. Both are applied to steamed or soaked beans, which are then allowed to dry. The solventa bind to caffeine and both purate when the beans are rinsed and/or dried. According to Us regulations, at least 97% of the caffeme must be removed to rarry the decaffeinated label, so there may be trace residual amounts of caffeine. Both methods may cause some loss of tlavor as other naturally occurring chemicals in coffee beans that impart their unique flavor and scent may be destroyed during processing</li>
